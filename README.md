# Building-The-Hack-Hardware-Platform
This repository holds .hdl files that modularly describes the Hack hardware platform by (Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. 2008. <i>The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles (History of Computing S.)</i>. The MIT Press).

The cited book aims to take the reader on a journey to build a simple but powerful 16-bit general-purpose computer. It gives you the knowledge to gradually and modularly implement it.  Besides, it follows an interface-implementation paradigm which is essential when building computers. In this journey, you start by building elementary logic gates, such as NOT, AND, OR, ..., and go all the way until you're able to run high-level applications, as the classic Tetris game, on the computer you've built.
